  <h2>I'm Multi-lingual!</h2>
  <p>
    Hey I'm Multi-Lingual but not in the way you think, that I'm Multi-lingual I know Computer languages!
    Well I mean I also speak Vietnamese, but that's besides the point. I am fluent in C++, HTML, JavaScript, CSS,
    PHP, and Assembly learning language. While I know the languages above, the ones I specialize in is C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I have been practicing C++ for a very long time, since it is my first language so I am more proficient in it's usage than most other
    languages, my second most used language would have to be HTML, and CSS since I was taught those languages. However my favorite language
    to use is always C++ since it is the language that introduced me to programming. I can use PHP, and Assembly learning language very adequately
    however I don't use it as much as the other languages.

  <h2>Front-End or Back-End?</h2>
  <p>
    Why not both? I do both Front-End and Back-End software development, you can check out some of my programs in the you can check out both my Front-End and Back-End code,
    if you're looking for some suff to launch and check out head over to however to my Project History the link to both will be provided down below, I specialize in Front-End more than Back-End. I am very flexible however, and can learn to quickly adapt to any situation with enough
    resources, and self-research I can adapt any skill set that is required for the job. One work that I've done involving Back-End and Front-end
    development is my College's portal, my Classmates and I had to recreate a section of the portal and that involved using a variety of languages.
    It was quite difficult, however it was also very fun and gave me a realistic outlook on the working world since then I've pursued other works
    involving either Front-End or Back-End programming.

    <h2>Work Preferences</h2>
    <p>
      I am very flexible with my work schedule, and company however I prefer to stay with in the area of the Lancaster Pennsylvania,
      I am not good at traveling and adapting to new Environments. I also have a family in the area that I'd like to stay close too,
      so if I were to work far away it would have to be through Email and Video conferences. However otherwise I work well in most environments,
      I can learn to adapt to my co-workers very well, work place harmony is a big and important factor for me. I will try my best to adapt to any cultural,
      ethnic, and social background customs that is required of me with in the work place as long as it is with in reason of course. I will also try to resolve
      any conflict I have with a fellow co-worker as best as I can and if I cannot do that then I will report to a higher-up.
