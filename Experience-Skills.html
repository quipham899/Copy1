      <h2>Good Traits</h2>
      <p> I'm a very responsible, and hard working employee who makes sure I get my work done. I try my best to befriend everyone I work with.
        I try my best to be understanding of everyone, and work with their needs as well as their preferences and work place habits.
        I do not discriminate against anyone regardless of Gender, Ethnicity, or creed I try to treat everyone, as fairly and as equally
        as possible. I try to fit into any role that is given to me on a team, as my main objective is to finish the job and deliver
        a finished and polished product, any other feelings or personal preference of mine is put second place to getting the task finished
        and put out as soon as possible, in the most efficient manner as possible. </p>
